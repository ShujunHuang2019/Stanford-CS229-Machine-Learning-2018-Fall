# Stanford-CS229-Machine-Learning-2018-Fall

Stanford's CS229 course taught by Andrew Ng is the most popular Machine Learning course Worldwide. It provides an overview of techniques for supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, as well as some results from computational learning theory. 

I will complete the online version and finish the problem sets in this repo.
